# RightMouseNavigation
Enables Unreal Engine-style Right Mouse Viewport Navigation:

Right Mouse Hold + WASD to Navigate 3D Viewport

Right Mouse Click to open Context Menus

Mouse Wheel to adjust Viewport Move Speed (while Right Mouse is held)

Thanks to *Biaru* for fixing the context menu/cursor location bug, and adding a 'mouse movement' threshold, in addition to the time threshold for fine-tuning when you navigate vs open the context menu!
